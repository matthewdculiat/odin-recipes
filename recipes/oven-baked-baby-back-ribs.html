        <h4>What Are Baby Back Ribs?</h4>
            <p>Baby back ribs (also called pork back ribs) come from high on the back of the hog, where the loin muscle meets the backbone. This lean cut of pork is extremely tender and flavorful.

        <h4>Baby Back vs. Spare Ribs</h4>
            <p>Spare ribs are cut from the bottom portion of the rib cage, while baby backs are cut from the top portion of the rib cage. Spare ribs are cut from the bottom portion of the rib cage, while baby backs are cut from the top portion of the rib cage. </p>
